## :one: Episode 1 (Install Debian)

First download VirtualBox and download Debian's .iso file. Here are the links:

- ✅ [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

- ✅ [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)

After installing open virtualbox:

Press the above will also be the new key!

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode1/1..png?raw=true" align="center" height="325">

Next next next.. and 'Machine Folder' your machine folder path will be '/goinfre' but but be careful the hard disk file type will be vdi.

And then choose **'.iso'** Debian file. Click on the virtual machine you have created and click **'settings'** above. and from there click on **'Storage'**, click on **'Empty'** and press the **CD** sign next to the **'Optical Drive'** option in the right window. From there, click on **'Choose Disk File'** and select your downloaded debian **'.iso' file.

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode1/2..png?raw=true" align="center" height="325">

After doing these, start your virtual machine and you will see this screen:

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode1/3.png?raw=true" align="center" height="350">
Select 'Grapichal' install'. (Don't worry, this option will not install Debian as UI. It will only install visually.)

The next part contains all pictures:

🏁 **And finally Episode 1 ends here..** 🏁

## :two: Episode 2 (Downloads and Adjustments and and Configurations)

You will see this screen, probably this is the login screen. :d

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/1.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">
<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/2.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">

You can see the partitions and encrypted partitions of your disk by running this command:

````lsblk````

Before proceeding with the downloads and configurations, it is useful to know these:

- Be root:

```` su -````

- Scan if there is an updated package:

````apt update````

- If there is a package that needs to be updated, update it:

````apt upgrade````

#### 🛎️ If You Want to Change the Hostname

Command to see hostname:

````hostname````

To change the hostname, let's enter the following file with nano **(you must be root)**:

````nano /etc/hostname````

You will probably see the hostname, yes change it and save:

````CTRL + O then ENTER and then CTRL + X to save and exit in nano````

Restart the computer after saving and exiting:

````reboot````

If you want to revert repeat these steps :d

#### 🧮 User Commands

Apart from these, the command to see the users in your virtual machine:

````getent passwd````

Commands for adding and deleting users **(you must be root)**:

````adduser <user_name>```` - ````deluser <username>````

#### 🍇 Group Commands

The command to see the groups in your virtual machine:

````getent group```` or ````getent group <group_name>```` -> **Users under a group**

Commands for adding and deleting groups **(you must be root)**:

````groupadd <group_name>```` - ````groupdel <group_name>````

#### 🤝 Commands of groups used with users

First command to see which group a user is in:

````groups <user_name>````

Command to add and remove a user from a group **(you must be root)**:

````usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name>```` - ````gpasswd --delete <user_name> <group_name>````

## 🛠️ Installing packages and configuring files

### 🧰 For SSH

Install SSH:

````apt install openssh-server````

SSH activity query command and ssh start commands:

````systemctl status ssh```` - ````systemctl start ssh```` - ````systemctl enable ssh````

#### :dna: SSH Port Change

You should go to this directory:

```bash
  nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
You should change these settings

- #Port 22 -> Port 4242
- #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin no
- And yes, remove the '#' as well, they will comment out what you wrote. :)
- Hey! by the way just remove the '#' signs for the 2 settings I mentioned above. :d

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/3.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">
<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/4.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">

Okay, after making these settings, restart with the command:

````service sshd restart````

Then come to your virtualbox and press **'settings'** at the top, then **'network'**, 
then there will be an **'Advanced'** pane at the bottom, click there and press **'Port Forwarding'**. 
You will see a button with a green **'+'** sign on the right, yes press it and something like a 
table will appear. Do as in the picture in the **'Host port'** and **'Guess Port'** sections. 
I'm already adding a picture, I don't know why I felt the need to explain. Anyway, press ok ok and it's over.

<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/5.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">
<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/6.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">

After doing these restart your virtual machine **(you must be root)**:

````reboot````

After these settings, you can now connect to the virtual machine from the physical machine.
How Does? that's it:

- Open your terminal from the physical machine and type the following command

```bash
  ssh your_42user_name@localhost -p 4242
```
<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/7.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">
<img src="https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/8.png?raw=true" align="center" height="300">

And you can access the virtual machine from the terminal of the physical machine by entering the password of the user in your virtual machine.

🚩 **Yes, SSH that was it..** 🚩

### 🛡️ For UFW

Install UFW:

````apt install ufw````

**Some UFW related commands**

Deny all requests to us:

````ufw default deny incoming````

Allow all outbound requests:

````ufw default allow outgoing````

Enable ufw on system startup (Reboot your virtual machine after doing this):

````ufw enable````

Check out UFW's status:

````ufw status```` - ````ufw status numbered```` -> number the rules

Allow incoming requests to port 4242 or deny this port:

````ufw allow 4242```` - ````ufw deny 4242````

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/9.png" align="center" height="300">

to delete a rule:

````ufw delete allow 4242```` -> this command deletes 'allow' rules 4242  ````ufw delete deny 4242```` -> deletes 'deny' rules 4242 <br/>
````ufw delete 1```` -> deletes rule 1

🚩 **Yes, UFW that was it..** 🚩

### :godmode: For Sudo

Configuring Sudo according to very very strict rules

Install Sudo:

````apt install sudo````

Add your user under the 'sudo' group before proceeding to the config settings:

````usermod -aG sudo <user_name>````

OK, we did a lot, now let's move on to the config settings: :d

````visudo```` -> Let's enter the configuration file with this command

A screen like this should come:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/10.png" align="center" height="300">

 Add some strict rules here:
 
 ```bash
  Defaults     passwd_tries=3 -> 3 wrong entries
  Defaults     badpass_message="Wrong Password!!!" -> wrong password message
  Defaults     requiretty -> terminal requirement for sudo command
  Defaults     logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log" -> logs of every sudo command entered
  Defaults     log_input, log_output -> I/O of sudo commands
  Defaults     iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo/" -> path of inputs and outputs
```

The last one should look like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/11.png" align="center" height="300">

To confirm these, you can exit 'root' and try what can be done with the sudo command..

🚩 **Yes, Sudo that was it..** 🚩

### ⛓️ Password Policy

**First, configure the password change frequency:**

```bash
  nano /etc/login.defs
```
You find it 'pass aging control':

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/12.png" align="center" height="300">

Then do it like this:

```bash
   PASS_MAX_DAYS   30
   PASS_MIN_DAYS   2
   PASS_WARN_AGE   7
```
**⚠️Yes, that's all, but this setting is valid for root and users after you (usr). To change your user and root's, do this⚠️**

First, let me prove it to you:

````chage -l root```` and ````chage -l <user_name>```` -> I think that's a enough proof :D

To change:

````chage root```` and ````chage <user_name>````

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/13.png" align="center" height="300">

You know what to do..

**Now let's add our password creation rules**

Install it:

````apt install libpam-pwquality````

Then follow this path:

```bash
   nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```
You will encounter something like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/14.png" align="center" height="300">

Here's what you need to change:

```bash
   difok = 7
   minlen = 10
   dcredit= -1
   ucredit= -1
   enforce_for_root
   enforcing= 1
   maxrepeat= 3
   usercheck = 1
   dictcheck = 1
```

I'm not going to write explanations, it's already written..

⚠️Yes, that's all, but after you've done these, you still need to change the passwords for root, your user, and all other users if you have created them

How does?

````passwd root```` and ````passwd <user_name>````

🏁**And finally Episode 2 ends here..**🏁

## 3️⃣ Episode 3 (Monitoring.sh and Crontab Configurations)

### 🗒️ Monitoring.sh

If you want to examine it, I shared the 'monitoring.sh' file above.

[Monitoring.sh](https://github.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/blob/master/Born2beroot/monitoring.sh)

### ⏰ Crontab (cron)

Type this command:

````crontab -e````

and write at the bottom:

```bash
*/10 * * * * bash /your/monitoring.sh_path
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fartomy/42-Kickoff/master/Born2beroot/Episode2/15.png" align="center" height="300">

🏁 **And finally Episode 3 ends here..** 🏁

## :four: Episode 4 (Submission and Peer-evaluation)

Now that everything is finished, it's time to get your disc signature:

First of all, you should go into the file we have installed in '/goinfre' and find your virtual machine. I'm assuming you went there as I wouldn't know where this is.

Type this:

````shasum <your_virtual_machine>.vdi```` -> It might take a while...

When your disk signature comes, you will send it to the 'signature.txt' file and get push. That's all. If you've come this far, 🥳CONGRATULATIONS!!!🥳

🏁**And finally Episode 4 ends here..**🏁

## 5️⃣ Extras and Resources

### ➕ Extras

1-) You can connect to your friends' virtual machine using SSH.

2-) With netchat, you can chat with your friends via terminal.

Materials:

- IPv4adress
````apt install net-tools```` then type ````ifconfig````

- Port
````netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'```` -> find open port

🥂 **How to use NetChat**

First of all, type the open port of your friend's PC into the terminal:

````nc -l <port>```` -> and ENTER. and your friend wait. then go to your own computer

After that, type your friend's IPv4 address and port number and press ENTER. Let the messaging begin! 🍔

````nc <IPv4_adress> <port>````
